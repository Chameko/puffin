# Puffin
A staticaly type checked scripting language designed to allow you to write code quickly while not shooting yourself in the foot.

## Why
Great question. I do have a few reasons for wanting to create my own language but the primary one
one is that I just really want to write my own programming language.


The other reason is because while I always liked the idea of dynamic programming languages in concept, allowing
you to quickly write code without worrying about types. But I find that while it makes the code easier to write
it also makes it more prone to errors and it becomes unclear how function that aren't properly documented are supposed to be used.

## Planned features

- [ ] Hot reloading
- [ ] Type checking
- [ ] Language server
- [ ] Simple and powerful rust integration
- [ ] Pattern matching
- [ ] Async support
