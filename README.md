# Puffin
A dynamic-ish scripting language designed to allow you to write code freely while not shooting yourself in the  foot.

## Why
Great question. I do have a few reasons for wanting to create my own language but the primary one
one is that I just really want to write my own programming language.
\
The other reason is because while I always liked the idea of dynamic programing languages in concept, allowing
you to quickly write code without worrying about types. But I always found that this lead to ambiguous code
and finding errors during runtime rather than compile time.

## Acknowledgements

### [Crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
Huge thanks to Robert Nystrom for writing Crafting Interpreters. If you ever want to write your
own programming language. This is the place to start

### [Rune](https://rune-rs.github.io/)
Big thanks to udoprog and the contributors behind Rune. A lot of inspiration was taken its source
code, which is extremely well documented (its actually really impressive). If you want to write
your own language in Rust I highly encourage you to read its source.
